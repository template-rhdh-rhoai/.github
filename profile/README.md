# OpenShift Template Project

This is a personal project focused on creating a template for deploying infrastructure on OpenShift. The template uses ArgoCD to set up everything needed for Red Hat OpenShift AI, Red Hat Developer Hub, and MinIO.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to simplify the process of deploying key components on OpenShift, including:

- **Red Hat OpenShift AI**: Set up AI workloads on OpenShift.
    
- **Red Hat Developer Hub**: Deploy a developer collaboration platform.
    
- **MinIO**: Deploy MinIO for S3-compatible object storage.
    

## Why This Template?

- **Automated Deployment**: Uses ArgoCD to automate infrastructure setup.
    
- **Scalable and Flexible**: Designed to be scalable to fit various workload needs.
